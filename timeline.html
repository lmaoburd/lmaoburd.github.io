                    Dragon Ball was one of the linchpins for what is accepted as the "Golden Age of Jump". The success from Dragon Ball encouraged Akira Toriyama to continue
                    working on the series from 1984 to 1995. During that 11-year period, he made 519 chapters collected into 42 tankōbon volumes. Each volume has an average of
                    200 pages, so the entire Dragon Ball storyline extends to almost 9,000 pages.

            <p style="margin-top:2%;font-size:20px">
                Akira Toriyama (鳥山明 Toriyama Akira) (born in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture) was a widely acclaimed Japanese manga artist and character designer who lived in Kiyosu.

            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">
                Toriyama had a love of cars and motorcycles, something he inherited from his father who used to operate an auto repair business. He was also an animal lover having
                kept many different species of birds, dogs, cats, fish, lizard and bugs. Toriyama had a lifelong passon for plastic models, having deisnged several for the Fine
                Mods brand and also collected autographs of famous manga artist.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">
                He first achieved mainstream recognition for creating the popular manga series Dr. Slump, before going on to create Dragon Ball (his most famous work) and acting
                as a character designer for several popular video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Toriyama came to be regarded as one of
                the most important authors in the history of manga with his works highly influential and popular, particularly Dragon Ball, which many manga artists cite as a
                source of inspiration.

                <p>"It’s just way too early. <br />The hole he has left is far too great.</p>

                <p>
                    I am crushed by an overwhelming sadness when I realize we will never see each other again.<br />
                    I have admired him so much ever since I was a child.<br />
                    I remember distinctly when he first called me by my name.<br />
                    And when he called me and Kishimoto-san his “friends” on that day we were on the way back to our homes,<br />
                    it brings back very fond memories.<br />
                    I even remember the exact words we exchanged during our conversations too.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He alone passed the baton from the generation where people thought reading manga would make you stupid to the generation where manga could be enjoyed by all, children and adults alike. <br />
                    He showed us a dream, that manga can do so many things, that it can connect you to the world. <br />
                    It was like watching a superhero come to life. <br />
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, his work was not just limited to manga. <br />
                    The excitement and emotions felt through the Dragon Ball series will forever take root in the youth of the creators of this industry. <br />
                    His existence is like that of a great tree. <br />
                </p>

                <p>
                    For all the manga artists of my generation, as we got closer to standing on the same stage as him, Toriyama’s work became an even greater presence that we felt deeply. It was almost scary. <br />
                    But it always made us happy to see him in person with his carefree attitude. <br />
                    Our love for Toriyama-sensei runs in the blood through our veins. <br />
                </p>

                <p>
                    With the creative world that Toriyama-sensei left behind in this world, I pray from the bottom of heart with respect and gratitude that he rest in peace. <br />

                <p>
                    May the Heaven he envisioned be a most joyous place for him." <br />

                <p>
                    I grew up with Dr. Slump in the lower grades of elementary school and <br />
                    Dragon Ball in the upper grades, and it was natural for me to have his <br />
                    manga next to me as part of my life. <br />
                    Even if I had a bad experience, watching Dragon Ball every week made me <br />
                    forget about it. It was a relief for me, a country boy who had nothing. <br />
                    Because Dragon Ball was really fun! <br />
                    It was when I was a university student. Suddenly, the Dragon Ball that had <br />
                    been a part of my life for so many years ended. <br />
                    I felt an incredible sense of loss and didn't know what to look forward to. <br />
                    But at the same time, it was also an opportunity for me to truly understand <br />
                    the greatness of the teacher who created Dragon Ball. <br />
                    I also want to create works like yours! <br />
                    I want to be like my teacher! <br />
                    As I followed in my teacher's footsteps and aspired to become a manga <br />
                    artist, that feeling of loss began to disappear. <br />
                    Because making comics was fun. <br />
                    I was able to find new fun by following my teacher. <br />
                    My teacher has always been my guide. <br />
                    I admired it. <br />
                    I apologize for the inconvenience, but I would like to express my gratitude <br />
                    to the teacher. <br />
                    For me, he was the god of salvation and the god of manga.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When we met for the first time, I was so nervous that I couldn't say a word. <br />
                    However, after meeting him many times at the Tezuka Prize screening <br />
                    committee, we became able to talk. <br />
                    As Dragon Ball Children, I and Mr. Oda went back to being children again, <br />
                    and when we talked excitedly about how much Dragon Ball was fun, as if <br />
                    we were competing with each other, I forgot how he looked a little <br />
                    embarrassed and smiled at me. I can't. <br />
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have just received the news of the death of my teacher. <br />
                    I feel an even greater sense of loss than when Dragon Ball ended... <br />
                    I still don't know how to deal with this hole in my heart. <br />
                    Now I can't even read my favorite Dragon Ball. <br />
                    I don't feel like I've been able to properly write this sentence that I want to <br />
                    convey to my teacher. <br />
                    Everyone around the world was still looking forward to seeing your work. <br />
                    If Dragon Ball's one wish really comes true...I'm sorry... <br />
                    Maybe that's selfish, but it's sad, sensei. <br
